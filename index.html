          <p class="destination">
            Thor was the son of Odin, the god of wisdom, poetry, healing, and death. Thor was the Norse god of thunder and lightning. With his weapon, Mjönir, he was the mightiest of warriors.

            Mjönir was forged by dwarfs. The hammer never failed Thor; it was used to crash down on the heads of giants and as an instrument to hallow people and things.

            Thor was the son of Odin. His mother was variously known as Jord, Hlödyn, or Fjörgyn, in all cases she was identified as a giant, making Thor half-jötunn. Thor married golden-haired Sif, a goddess associated with faith, family, and fertility. With Sif, Thor had a daughter known as Thudr, who may have become a valkryie.
