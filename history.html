        <h2>History of Thor</h2>
        <p>
            Following myths of Thor in Nordic mythology, Thor was soon represented in Marvel Cinematics, as well as comics. Thor has a slightly different role in Marvel, as he joins a team of earthly, and non-earthly, heroes to help combat against threats to Earth. He is still depicted as the god of thunder and still has Mj√∂nir. He is from Asgard and is raised with an adopted brother, Loki.
